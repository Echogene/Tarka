Additional Libraries
====================
The source code currently needs no additional libraries, but the test code does.  It needs
- [JUnit](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Download-and-Install)
- [Reflections](https://code.google.com/p/reflections/), which in turn needs
  - [Javassist](https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist)
  - [Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/)
